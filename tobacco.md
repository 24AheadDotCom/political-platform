Advertising programs proven effective against tobacco use will be increased. All advertising will be clearly marked as to the source; no propaganda such as working with movie studios will be used.

Alternatives to tobacco use and smoking cessation programs will be promoted and subsidized in some cases.

This political party will work to expose and discredit those who are in effect paid to spread propaganda favorable to tobacco companies.

The goal of these objectives will not be to revile smokers themselves, simply to encourage them to kick the habit.
