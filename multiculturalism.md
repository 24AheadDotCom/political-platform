# Multiculturalism

This political party and the government will oppose "Canadian style multiculturalism": a country consisting of a set of groups in their own communities. Speaking a language other than English at home won't be opposed unless it impedes childrens' ability to speak English. Preserving ethnic traditions and so on won't be opposed. However, any attempts to create a country within a country - a large, cohesive group functioning separately from the rest of the country - will be strongly opposed.
