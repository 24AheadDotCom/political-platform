Political platform

The political platforms of the Democratic and Republican Parties do not represent the positions of most Americans. Both Parties are also swayed by their more leftwing and "conservative" factions, pushing them further from what most Americans want. Both Parties are also deeply corrupt.

The (as yet unnamed) political platform outlined in this repository aims to fix that, proposing ideas that most Americans support and that seek what's best for most Americans.

Feel free to fork this repository to create your own version of the platform.
