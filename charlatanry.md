# Charlatans and Entertainers

It isn't difficult to find political charlatans and those who are simply entertainers. They agitate their audiences, but they offer no solutions besides buying their products. Some organizations conduct endless fundraising campaigns, but never actually do anything. This political party will support the right of those people and organizations to speak, but will oppose them otherwise. This political party will not enable - for instance by inviting them to official functions - political entertainers who simply agitate their audience without suggesting solutions.
