This political party will oppose election laws that favor the Democrat/Republican duopoly.

The party will support campaign finance reform with the goals of limiting the influence of big money (of all types) on policies and of freeing up representatives to concentrate on the people's business. The exact form of that reform will be determined through debating the possibilities. The specific plans of groups like mayday.us will be considered.
