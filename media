This political party will very aggressively seek to discredit reporters that mislead about issues of interest to the party. That will include writing articles describing how a reporter misled about a specific issue, directly challenging reporters who mislead, and so on. Major media reporters nearly without exception represent the interests of the elites; holding reporters accountable will hold the elites accountable by making it difficult for the elites to mislead about issues of interest to them. This political party will oppose "fluff" articles, such as stories about what a candidate had for breakfast. Whenever possible, this party will attempt to turn the debate back to a politician's positions on key policies.

As necessary, this political party will commission its own reports on key issues with those reports very clearly marked as coming from the party.
