# Accountability

A key difference between this political party and others is that we fully support holding politicians accountable. That means voting, but voting isn't enough. This political party strongly supports engaging politicians in real, substantial debate about important topics using the [Question Authority](http://24ahead.com/s/question-authority) plan.

Any candidate running on this platform and all other politicians should be willing - at the proper venue - to engage in detailed debate about their policies. If a politician is incapable of defending their policy positions, then they should either find another line of work or find better policies.

In addition to encouraging better politicians, the Question Authority plan will encourage better reporters. When regular citizens repeatedly break news by asking politicians tough questions while establishment media reporters are conducting fluff interviews about what sort of tie a politician wears, those reporters' publications will be forced to reform.

Moreover, regular citizens engaging politicians in debate will lead to better policies. Politicians will be much less able to promote bad policies using deceptive talking points. If they can't defend their flawed policies, they'll be forced to find policies that are defensible.
