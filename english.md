# English

One goal of this political party is to ensure that as many Americans as possible are fluent in English and to discourage the use of non-English languages in politics. One reason is that politicians have been known to say one thing in English and something different in another language. Another reason is to reduce the influence of demagogic ethnic power brokers: community leaders who consolidate power by speaking the same language or dialect as a group which includes those with limited English proficiancy.

In order to achieve that goal, this political party will support making English the official language of the U.S. to whatever extent is feasible. The party will oppose such now-ubiquitous features as "Press 1 for English".

This party's immigration position will free up resources for ESL classes, and those with limited English proficiancy will be encouraged to attend.

The party will support Americans learning foreign languages for personal enjoyment, family reasons, to do business with foreign companies, and so on. However, the party will strongly oppose attempts to encourage Americans to learn foreign languages in order to conduct non-emergency [daily business inside the U.S.](http://24ahead.com/blog/archives/007811.html)
