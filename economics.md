# Economics

This political party will support "Third Way" economics: the free market with very strong protections against abuse. The U.S. currently has such an economy in large part, and few Americans would want either socialism or the laissez-faire/libertarian system even if some say they do.

This political party will strongly oppose the libertarian/NeoLiberal economic mindset: loose immigration, "free trade", money being paramount over other issues, etc.
