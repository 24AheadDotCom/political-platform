Anyone who's engaged in debates on social media or in comments sections on political sites has seen endless examples of dishonesty, smears, ad hominem attacks, and other illogical arguments. Other political parties do the same things, but this political party will strongly oppose that type of behavior. Other political parties also send "trackers" to catch opposing politicians in gaffes and the like; this political party will attempt to engage our opponents in debate about policy instead.

This political party will still defend and advance its interests aggressively, but will do so in an honest, logical manner. That doesn't mean being "Goody Two-Shoes", just not presenting smears and illogical arguments as a valid argument.
