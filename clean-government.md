# Clean government

This political party will oppose not just obvious and currently illegal forms of corruption like kickbacks. This political party will also oppose less obvious forms of corruption, such as politicians taking donations from big business and in return enabling illegal immigration.

Aside from cases involving trade secrets, national security, and the like, this political party will support transparency in government to the greatest extent possible.
