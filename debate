* a government elections website will be created that devotes a page to all candidates for national office from all parties
* all candidates for national office will be required to take part in policy debates. A panel of experts from all ideologies - even those considered outside the "mainstream" - will be able to ask a candidate and their experts specific questions about their policies. These will be live-streamed on the elections website and will be broadcast on CSPAN, PBS, or - if absolutely necessary - time will be purchased on commercial TV. A transcript will be posted immediately to the elections website. Each debate will be about one topic and will not consist of the candidate giving canned speeches or recounting their positions for the umpteenth time. Instead, the panel will ask questions about policy ideas the candidates have already stated.
* in addition to those debates, the presidential candidates and all other candidates for national office will have to take part in a few instances of the plan on the http://24ahead.com/s/popular-voting-systems page. That will be conducted on the same elections website.
