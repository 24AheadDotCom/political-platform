# Racial favoritism

Hate crime laws, affirmative action, college and other discounts based on race, and all other forms of racial favoritism will be eliminated wherever possible. Likewise with laws showing favoritism based on gender and sexual orientation.

Laws forbidding reasonable discrimination will remain in effect.

Laws designed to protect younger, older, and disabled Americans will remain in effect.

Affirmative action and discounts based on an individual's or their family's income will not be effected and will be encouraged as a replacement for race-based affirmative action and discounts.
