# Climate change (aka anthropogenic global warming)

This political party believes that reasonable steps should be taken to minimize anthropogenic global warming ("AGW"). If we're wrong, there might be a resulting loss in economic activity as well as other negative consequences. If we're right, we'll have averted what could be a catastrophe, and that's more important.

The main reason for that calculation is that it's impossible to tell who to trust: both sides aren't credible and many are motivated by economic or political concerns.

This party will oppose attempts to free-ride other issues on the climate change issue, such as "environment justice", or attempts to restrict privacy or speech. This party will also oppose attempts by some to scaremonger the issue or unjustly position themselves in order to gain money or power.

This party will also oppose attempts by global warming opponents to downplay the issue, such as by complaining about hypocrisy when a climate change believer drives an SUV or by pointing to a cold weather spell as proof that climate change isn't happening.
