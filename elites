Today's elites have nearly as much free rein as European royalty of hundreds of years ago. The elites are able to pursue policies - loose immigration, free trade, etc. - that serve their goals and everyone else is incapable of doing anything about it. For decades the elites have been acting as a completely separate body to the rest of the U.S., "trading for their own account" rather than putting the national interest first.

This political party will not be anti-elites, but will seek to change the situation and force the elites to put the national interest first.

There are various reasons why the elites are able to do what they've been doing. One reason is that most Americans simply aren't politically involved. Those who are politically involved and who've claimed to want to keep the elites in check have done things the wrong way, such as camping in public parks or engaging in cheap stunts.

The first thing This political party will do to change the situation is realizing that the media is the key tool the elites use to push their agenda. The objectives in the Media and other sections in this platform will go a long way towards changing the situation.
