The tax system will be reformed so that all taxes will go up for the wealthy and go down for those less wealthy whenever feasible. If some "Job Creators" decide to leave the U.S. - a la Eduardo Saverin - then good riddance: they weren't Americans to begin with. It's better that they showed their true colors sooner rather than later.
